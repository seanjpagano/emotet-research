Need to add multiprocessing
Get all malicious files from a list of known bad links
Run md5sum on files and group them in folders as such
Fuzzy hashing
Run through olevba.py - hashing/fuzzy hasing
Analyze obfuscation techniques

mal_url = 
{
"filename":"",
"hash":"",
"path_to_file":"",
"path_to_macro":"",
"macro_hash":"",
"macro_obfuscation":"",
"files_dropped":"link_to_droppped_file_attrs"
}

"dropped_file" = 
{
"hash":
"mquery_for_more_info"
